					<p>Sometimes, I make graphics in my leisure. Here are some examples (they may be ages 
					old...):</p>
					<img src='images/eventide_img.png' alt='A picture to illustrate the moment just before the sun
					sets entirely.'>
					<img src='images/shadower_img.png' alt='A drawing that I outlined using Adobe Illustrator.'>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>I also take part in competitions as well. Here are some drawings and graphics that I used
					in my competition entries: </p>
					<img src='images/humanoid_img.png' alt='This drawing was submitted for a competition named
					"X-Site" and allowed a team of students to enter the finals of the competition'>
					<img src='images/landscape_img.png' alt='The poster was submitted for the same competition,
					but unfortunately, did not manage to attain anything.'>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>At times, we are tasked to make posters or design logos for my CCA (Infocomm Club). Here
					are some examples of what I have created: </p>
					<img src='images/recruitment2010_img.jpg' alt='This poster was done for the recruitment 
					drive in 2010.'>
					<img src='images/logo.png' alt='The logo was a revamped version of the previous Infocomm Club
					logo and was used in the making of the club hoodie in 2012.'>
					<img src='images/bunny.png' alt='The unofficial mascot of the club was created as a design
					for the club hoodie in 2012.'>
					<p>The unofficial mascot of the club, the 'Techno Bunny', was created with the idea of
					allowing our club to 'leap to greater heights'.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>I made countless other posters for schoolwork as well, but the one below is my greatest 
					pride. It was illustrated to explain a chinese phrase with pictorial elements.</p>
					<img id='poster' src='images/cme_poster.jpg' alt='A poster depicting a chinese phrase.'>
