			<h2>What I Like</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Simple Yet Special Things</p>
						<p>I like things that are simple, yet special. I believe that everyone is unique in their
						own way, so there isn't a need for you to copy anyone's style. It's the same for designs
						and ideas too. Each of us thinks in a different and special way, so we will formulate
						different ideas based on what we know. So, why copy when you can be special and 
						unique? </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Stories</p>
						<p>Personally, I've written many stories, but most of them were inspired by the stories
						that I hear everyday. Throughout the years, I've realised that I can't stand games that
						don't have a clear plot or rich plot. They seem to be the only things that keep the games
						going (or, at least, keeps me playing the game). So, unless the game has a wonderful
						plot, don't bother getting me to try it :P </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Amazing/Inspiring People</p>
						<p>I've always admired people who dare to chase their dreams and go against conventional
						thinking.
