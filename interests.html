			<h2>My Interests and Disinterests</h2>
			<p>Below is a list of things that I like and dislike. I figured that if I had to write about things
			that I like, I might as well make a list of things that I dislike as well. It's easier to write about
			your hatred with a passion, rather than to write about things that you like. But nevertheless, this
			list was an enjoyable one to make :) </p>
			<h2>What I Like</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Simple Yet Special Things</p>
						<p>I like things that are simple, yet special. I believe that everyone is unique in their
						own way, so there isn't a need for you to copy anyone's style. It's the same for designs
						and ideas too. Each of us thinks in a different and special way, so we will formulate
						different ideas based on what we know. So, why copy when you can be special and 
						unique? </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Stories</p>
						<p>Personally, I've written many stories, but most of them were inspired by the stories
						that I hear everyday. Throughout the years, I've realised that I can't stand games that
						don't have a clear plot or rich plot. They seem to be the only things that keep the games
						going (or, at least, keeps me playing the game). So, unless the game has a wonderful
						plot, don't bother getting me to try it :P </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Amazing/Inspiring People</p>
						<p>I've always admired people who dare to chase their dreams and go against conventional
						thinking. They are really courageous to take on challenges that most would avoid and it
						is that bravery that inspires me to work towards my goals no matter how ridiculous they
						may be. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>My School</p>
						<p>If I am given the chance to go back into the past and make a decision again, I would
						still apply to my current school, Dunman High. I like the school culture and its focus
						on the character development of the students. To me, a person's character is of utmost
						importance while the rest is secondary. And the fact that Dunmanians actually live up to
						their name makes me feel really proud to be one. Most of the people here are awesome too,
						if you get to know them :) And I'm glad that I managed to form many friendships here in
						Dunman High :D </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>What I Hate</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>I can't stand being alone</p>
						<p>I guess you can call it a fear or something, but if I am ever alone, I get bouts of
						depression and I will start to feel fear settling in. Even when I'm in a crowd, I get
						lonely easily if I don't associate myself with anyone there. I'm sure that everyone's
						afraid of being lonely, but as for me, loneliness is probably a fear that I can never
						overcome. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I hate hypocrites</p>
						<p>Just because you want to look good in front of other people doesn't mean you have to 
						pretend to be nice. I hate it when people say something in front of one person and say
						another in front of the next. It's called double-crossing and it reflects the lack of
						integrity and sincerity in you. And that's what irks me... =.= </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I hate people who look down upon others</p>
						<p>You may be better than average, but that doesn't give you the right to look down on
						other people and deprive them of the opportunity to achieve excellence. It just reflects
						how much you want to stay at the top of your game while you prevent others from surpassing
						you. The worst thing is when you mock others for their lack of ability while you lack the
						most basic form of respect. Thus, you don't deserve any respect at all. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I hate it when girls allow themselves to be stereotyped</p>
						<p>Some girls deliberately show themselves as weak individuals who always need help in the
						most trivial of situations. The worst thing is when they do so just to attract attention
						to themselves. But they are actually conforming themselves to societal expectations of
						what being a female is about. Perhaps my hatred for such people is also due to the fact
						that they are not being original at all. Hmm... </p>
					</li>
