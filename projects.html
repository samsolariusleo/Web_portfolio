					<p>Sometimes, I make graphics in my leisure. Here are some examples (they may be ages 
					old...):</p>
					<img src='images/eventide_img.png' alt='A picture to illustrate the moment just before the sun
					sets entirely.'>
					<img src='images/shadower_img.png' alt='A drawing that I outlined using Adobe Illustrator.'>

					<p>I also take part in competitions as well. Here are some drawings and graphics that I used
					in my competition entries: </p>
					<img src='images/humanoid_img.png' alt='This drawing was submitted for a competition named
					"X-Site" and allowed a team of students to enter the finals of the competition'>
					<img src='images/landscape_img.png' alt='The poster was submitted for the same competition,
					but unfortunately, did not manage to attain anything.'>
