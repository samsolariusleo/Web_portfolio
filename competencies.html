			<h2>What I am good at</h2>
			<p>I can't really say that I'm good at something, neither can I say that I'm totally useless
			too. But I guess here are some stuff that people have been telling me I am good at:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>Basic Python</p>
					<p>I guess I've been able to do my Python assignments without any help from anywhere except
					the internet. I can write some Python codes as well, but my comprehension is lacking. I hope to
					be able to resolve this problem soon though :)
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>HTML</p>
					<p>If I weren't fine/competent in HTML, I probably wouldn't have been able to build this page.
					But then, my skills aren't that great yet, as I still have to refer to resources over the web
					to get my codes right and learn how to actually make stuff. Nevertheless, I'm still quite
					comfortable with the coding conventions as of now :) </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Graphics Design</p>
					<p>I've been making quite a few graphics for the past few years. Although there were times
					when I almost won a prize, I would say that my skills are only at the basic or intermediate
					level. My best friend (whom I call "Nyan") has much better skills than I do at these things.
					She has already won two competitions in a row with her awesome graphics skills and I really
					hope that I will be able to achieve something like that in the future :)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Writing Fiction</p>
					<p>I can't write articles or essays well yet... But as for stories and random stuff, I guess
					I'm doing fine. I also like to write songs, though none of them are completed as of now.
					I used to write stories really often before life got busy. I currently have 10 stories written,
					with 7 completed. If you want to learn more about this part of my life, you can check out
					<a href="about.html">this link</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Vocals</p>
					<p>I've heard from people that I'm good with my vocals, though I can't really agree with that
					since I'm still a little uncomfortable with using my voice. It's something I'll have to work
					on too. I've never taken any official classes before, so I'm hoping that I will be able to
					get things ironed out on my own.</p>
				</li>
