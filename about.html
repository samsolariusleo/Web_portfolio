			<h2>Some Quirky Facts About Me</h2>
				<p>There are some things you might not know about me. So, I guess this is a 'General Knowledge'
				quiz? So, here go the fun-facts!</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>When I was really young, my parents would send me to Mediacorp for drama 
						lessons.</p>
						<p class='bottom'>It's those sorts of lessons where you sing songs and do what little kids 
						do in nurseries. But we just do more of those stuff, I guess. I've practically lost all
						my notes from those classes, but I still remember performing on the stage for the first 
						time as a year-end concert or something. It was just a group of us doing a weird song,
						and I was still an awkward kid back then, so I guess I've come a long way since then.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>I used to have a fascination over scissors.</p>
						<p class='bottom'>When I was really young, my mom bought me a pair of yellow scissors. I 
						liked it so much that I always avoided sharing it with other people. One day, it got 
						really sticky and difficult to use, so the people around me started to suggest that I buy 
						another pair, but I still ignored them anyways. Then last year, it mysteriously disappeared
						after I lent it to someone during NDP celebrations in school. I haven't seen it since.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>I used to be very soft-spoken in class.</p>
						<p class='bottom'>I remember when I was in Primary 3, my teacher would ask questions and when I tried to 
						answer them, he would tell me to speak up. I was so soft-spoken that he had to write it 
						down in my report book for my parents... But since then, I learnt how to speak up in class
						and now I'm even louder than usual when I sing. So, I guess my teacher was a huge 
						inspiration to me :)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>I actually ship fictionous characters.</p>
						<p class='bottom'>Depending on how much you know me, this might be quite of a shock to you. There are two
						 American TV shows that I am obsessing over right now, which are iCarly and Victorious, 
						 and I ship Seddie and Bade respectively. I am a HUGE shipper, but I don't obsess over them
						 too much, so I'm just a less-than-average shipper. I do read almost everything about them 
						 though. HAHA </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>I used to write Fanfiction</p>
						<p class='bottom'>I still do, actually, but lss frequently. I have written 10 stories so far, out of 
						which 7 are completed, one of them is a sequel of the other and one other one is a one-shot.
						The most number of words I wrote for one story was 29,095 words and the most number of 
						reviews I've gotten is 153, both of which belong to the same story. The longest fanfic I've 
						written was 23 chapters long and I wrote 2 of these 23-chapter stories. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>When I first read a Fanfiction, I thought it was describing a real episode.</p>
						<p class='bottom'>The first fanfic I read was one about Danny Phantom. I used to be really obsessed over 
						him and I kind of have all the episodes in my drive... heheh... So, I was researching on 
						Danny Phantom episodes (since Singapore was millions of years slower in broadcasting) 
						and I came across the fic. I liked it and I was really excited because I thought it was a 
						real episode. But when I continued with my research, it was then that I realised that it 
						was	fan-written. I was a bit disappointed at first, but I had discovered a new place to
						express my creativity. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>I won a writer's competition in 2011.</p>
						<p class='bottom'>I only won the Under-18 Category though, which isn't the first prize, 
						but I feel that it's a really big achievement for me. Like the unusually soft-hearted
						person I am, I donated about 25% of it to charity - just like I promised myself I would
						when I was younger.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>I hate many people.</p>
						<p class='bottom'>I don't like people who are not talented, but think they are. It's annoying when 
						they appear in every single show and people still like them. It's insane how majority of 
						the world are blind. People who really appreciate music can tell who's out of tune and the
						people who really appreciate their sight will know what they want to avoid watching. 
						I also hate those people who have betrayed my trust. Those are the most sickening people 
						in my point of view. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>I want to be a performer when I grow up.</p>
						<p class='bottom'>I think those in DHS should know about this because I believe I am quite well-known for
						appearing onstage. I've been trying to gain EXP in the performing arts (not in terms of CCA 
						though) so that I can 'level up' one day and become a professional entertainer. I'm not 
						sure exactly which path to take, but I really hope that I can become a singer/actress/popstar 
						though my dreams are probably too big to achieve... HAHA </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p class='top'>My role-model is Elizabeth Gillies (@LizGillies on Twitter)</p>
						<p class='bottom'>She's 19 years old and she's been on a Broadway Musical. Her personality is very unique 
						and she isn't afraid to show her true self. Unlike some teenager-actors, she actually has 
						talent. She can act really well and she has a beautiful voice. The coolest thing about her
						is that she shares the same horoscope as me :) She's an awesome person in real-life 
						and I really hope to be able to meet her one day. If I ever get famous one day, I would 
						ask her to star in a movie with me or sing a duet with me. It would be really cool :D </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<p>So, yeah. That's 10 things you probably don't know about me. If I ever think of anything else, 
			maybe I'll add them to this list? :D</p>
